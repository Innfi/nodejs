* a simple repository to test the viability of migration from typeorm to drizzle orm 
  in terms of type-safely, inter-operability (during the migration phase), 
  and the perks of its own

# TODO

# DONE
* setup a basic entity relation (1 - n - n will fit) in typeorm syntax
* add a CRUD operations around the relation (through the api layer)
* rewrite a drizzle orm version of database operations
* compare the two methods result in the same output
